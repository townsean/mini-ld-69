# mini-ld-69
Source code for my [MiniLD #69](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/07/10/minild-69-colonization/) entry, The Spread.  The theme for [MiniLD #69](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/07/10/minild-69-colonization/) is colonization.

Play it [here](https://townsean.github.io/mini-ld-69/)!

## Synopsis

The Spread is an abstract, 3D puzzle game.  Players aim a ball and launch it into a group of existing balls.  When the launched ball makes contact with another ball it spreads its color to the ball it touched. This may trigger a ripple effect if the contacted ball is pushed into another ball.  The objective of the game is to *colonize* all of the balls by spreading the original ball color to all of the balls.

## Motivation

I really struggled with brainstorming game ideas that would fit the theme of colonization, but there was one thing I was settled on:  I wanted to learn how to use [Babylon.js] (http://www.babylonjs.com/).  Creating a 3D game introduced one major problem:  I lacked the skill for creating original 3D game assets.  Because of this, I decided on creating an abstract game using primitive 3D shapes.
