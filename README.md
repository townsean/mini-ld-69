# mini-ld-69
Source code for my [MiniLD #69](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/07/10/minild-69-colonization/) entry, The Spread.  The theme for [MiniLD #69](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/07/10/minild-69-colonization/) is colonization.

Play it [here](https://townsean.github.io/mini-ld-69/)!

## Synopsis

The Spread is an abstract, 3D puzzle game.  Players aim a ball and launch it into a group of existing balls.  When the launched ball makes contact with another ball it spreads its color to the ball it touched. This may trigger a ripple effect if the contacted ball is pushed into another ball.  The objective of the game is to colonize all of the balls by spreading the original ball color to all of the balls.

## Motivation

I really struggled with brainstorming game ideas that would fit the theme of colonization, but there was one thing I was settled on:  I wanted to learn how to use [Babylon.js] (http://www.babylonjs.com/).  Creating a 3D game introduced one major problem:  I lacked the skill for creating original 3D game assets.  Because of this, I decided on creating an abstract game using primitive 3D shapes.
